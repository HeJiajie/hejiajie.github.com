I've encountered an annoying scenario in netease account product(reg.163.com) today, Here it is:


To improve the account security, I followed the instructions to set the "security phone" and "security email" one by one. I set the phone number right and after an sms check it was done, however, while I entered the "security email" I made a mistake and enter a wrong email address (it happens to be a non-existed gmail address, cause gmail forbit '_' present in the username). Since I had no ways to access an non-existed gmail account, I couldn't activate this "security email". O_o


My next try, naturally, was trying to modify the "security email", but firstly I have to visit the old "security email" to confirm this modification. O_o


##More Investment
Security email is a common try for improving account security. But different products have different logic behind modification permission granting:

**[163 account](reg.163.com)**
account password + (sms check or security questions) + old security email check => security email modification

**[google account](accounts.google.com)**
account password => security email modifycation

Obviously google's logic is much simpler. 


##Chatter
Don't want to dive deep in this security account logic. Just log down some of my thoughts:

-Security email is not that important as it once was;
-2-step verification (sms+password), which both products are using, is enough and convenient;
-Better to simplify the steps for modify security email/question, but be careful about security phone.
