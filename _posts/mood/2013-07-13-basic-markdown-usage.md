Hello world!

This is my first blog on Jekyll & GitHub!

Following are basic markdown usages:

## Headline & emphasis
Use "#" to mark headline, as
## this is a h2
### this is a h3
use "&#42;" to emphasize points

*Hey, pay attention here*

**Hey, pay attention here, too**

---

## Quoting
Use '>' for blogquoting, as
> Somebody said blablabla...

> Somebody also said blablabla...
For code only add 4 space at the beginning of line, as

Java:

    System.out.println("Hello world");

C:

    print("Hello world");

---

## Listing
Use '-' or '+' for unsorted list, as

Shopping list:
- Toy helicopter
- Suites
- IPhone

Use number for sorted list, as
1. firstly
2. secondly
3. last but not least

---

## Linking
Use '[title](link)' for links, as

[Swap it out](http://hejiajie.github.io)

Similarly you can link to a image, just put a '!' before it, as

![Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png)
